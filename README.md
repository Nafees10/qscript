QScript is a fast, and simple scripting language.<br>
QScript has been designed and tested on only Linux, and I have no plans to add support for Windows.
<br>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Declare functions inside scripts</li>
	<li>Easy and unique (a bit like C) syntax</li>
	<li>Dynamic arrays</li>
	<li>Open Source</li>
	<li>Fast execution - or should I say, very fast.</li>
	<li>More features on the way, qscript is still in beta</li>
</ol>
