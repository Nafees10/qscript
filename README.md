####This is the dev branch, not stable!  
QScript is a fast, and simple scripting language.  
###Features:   
1. Declare functions inside scripts
2. Easy and unique (a bit like C) syntax
3. Arrays
5. Fast execution - or should I say, very fast.
6. More features on the way, qscript is still in beta
7. One script can have several functions, making it usable for 'event-based scripting'
8. Dynamic typed, yet very fast.

P.S: Updates have slowed down, a lot, because I am nowadays very busy with my studies.
