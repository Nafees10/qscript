## QScript is a fast, and simple scripting language.
### Features:
1. Easy and unique (a bit like C) syntax
2. Arrays - Dynamic Arrays, length can be changed at runtime
3. Fast execution - or should I say, very fast.
4. More features on the way, qscript is still in beta
5. One script can have several functions, making it usable for 'event-based scripting'
6. Dynamic typed, yet very fast.
